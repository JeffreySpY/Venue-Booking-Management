This lightweight plugin allows user to create a Dashboard widget with frequently accessed wp-admin menu for quick access.

== Description ==

This lightweight plugin allows user to create a Dashboard widget with frequently accessed wp-admin menu for quick access.

I originally develop this plugin after spending hours of time creating client/user documentation for every WordPress projects. Instead of writting step by step navigation documentation, I used this script to organize all necessary links on the single widget for non-technical users. As a developer, I also use this script myself to organize frequently accessed wp admin links for quick access.

If you have any feedback or queries please contact developer at <a href="http://hemthapa.com?ref=wp_dqlw" target="_blank">hemthapa.com</a>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

You need to put each link in separate line in following format
(fourth parameter, i.e. font awesome icon class is optional)
